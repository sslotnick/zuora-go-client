# **POSTAccount**
> PostAccountResponseType POSTAccount($request, $entityId, $entityName, $zuoraVersion)

Create account

This REST API reference describes how to create a customer account with a credit-card payment method, a bill-to contact, and an optional sold-to contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. Use this method to optionally create a subscription, invoice for that subscription, and collect payment through the default payment method. The transaction is atomic; if any part fails for any reason, the entire transaction is rolled back.  This API call is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript to invoke the call.   ## Notes 1. The account is created in active status.   2. The request must provide either a **creditCard** structure or the **hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId** field (but not both). The one provided becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card information is declined or can't be verified, then the account is not created. 3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto Pay. 4. If either the **workEmail** or **personalEmail** are specified, then the account's email delivery preference is automatically set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) If neither field is specified, the email delivery preference is automatically set to `false`.  ## Defaults for customerAcceptanceDate and serviceActivationDate Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.  |        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default | | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

# **PUTAccount**
> CommonResponseType PUTAccount($accountKey, $request, $entityId, $entityName)

Update account

This REST API reference describes how to update a customer account by specifying the account-key.  ## Notes 1. Only the fields to be changed should be specified.  Any field that's not included in the request body will not be changed. 2. If an empty field is submitted with this call, the corresponding field in the account is emptied. 3. Email addresses: If no email addresses are specified, no change is made to the email addresses on file or to the email delivery preference. If either the **personalEmail** or **workEmail** is specified (or both), the system updates the corresponding email address(es) on file and the email delivery preference is set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) On the other hand, if as a result of this call both of the email addresses for the account are empty, the email delivery preference is set to `false`. 4. The bill-to and sold-to contacts are separate data entities; updating either one does not update the other.
